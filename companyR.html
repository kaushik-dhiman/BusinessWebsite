        <h2 class="title mb-3">Proprietorship Registration</h2>
        <p class="mb-0">A sole proprietorship is a type of unregistered business entity that is owned, managed and controlled by one person. Sole proprietorship’s
    are one of the most common forms of business in India, used by most micro and small businesses operating in the unorganised sectors.Proprietorships are
    very easy to start and have very minimum regulatory compliance requirement for started and operating.There is no mechanism provided by the Government of
    India for the registration of a Proprietorship. Therefore, the existence of a proprietorship must be established through tax registrations and other business registrations that a business is required to have as per the rules and regulations.Proprietorship is recognized by other registrations, such as a Goods and Service Tax Registration (GST). It has too many shortcomings, such as unlimited liability of proprietor, and it does not have continuous existence. For these reasons it is considered by small merchants and traders as a business structure.</p>

<br><br>Partnership is an association of two or more persons to carry on a business in the capacity of co-owners. Each such person is called a partner. All the partners share the profits and losses in proportion of their respective ownership, or as agreed between them.

    <h2 class="title mb-3"><br>Private Limited Company Registration</h2>
    <p class="mb-0">Private Limited Company, the most popular legal structure for businesses, should be chosen by anyone looking to build a scalable business. It is one of the most popular legal structure option for businesses in India. A Private limited company has a minimum of two members and a maximum of fifty members. A director of a private limited company has limited liability to creditors. In case of a default, banks / creditors can sell only company’s assets but not the personal assets of a director. A Private limited company is considered one of the most popular corporate entities amongst the small, medium and the large businesses in India due to its various advantages. Start-ups and growing businesses choose to register a company in India because it allows outside funding to be raised easily, limits the liabilities of its shareholders and enables them to offer employee stock options to attract top talent. As these entities must hold board meetings and file annual returns with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), they tend also to be viewed with more credibility than a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP), One Person Company (OPC). To incorporate a private limited company, a minimum of two shareholders are required. A minimum of two shareholders and a maximum of up to 200 shareholders are allowed in a private limited company. The shareholders could be natural persons or companies, including foreign companies. Unique features of a private limited company like limited liability protection to shareholders, ability to raise equity funds, separate legal entity status and perpetual existence make it the most recommended type of business entity for millions of small and medium sized businesses that are family owned or professionally managed.

        <h2 class="title mb-3"><br>One Person Company Registration</h2>
      <p class="mb-0">An Entrepreneur is an individual who chooses to go into business by himself. Often entrepreneurs decide to stay a one-person company to keep decisions and quality of work under control. These single entrepreneurs are often called solo-entrepreneurs, too. These entrepreneurs are often referred to as free agents, freelancer, self-employed, sole proprietor, or home based business owner (although not all single person entrepreneurs are home-based). This often depends on the professional field they work in. The concept of One Person Company in India was introduced through the Companies Act, 2013 to support entrepreneurs who on their own are capable of starting a venture by allowing them to create a single person economic entity. One of the biggest advantages of a One Person Company (OPC) is that there can be only one member in a OPC, while a minimum of two members are required for incorporating and maintaining a Private Limited Company or a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP). You can easily register one Person Company under the outlines of the companies Act 2013 and the laws thereto, where it was made viable for a single person company to work as a company without the complexity of having partners. This encourages more people to come forward to commence a business. The OPC is fit for small businesses where the turnover is not likely to cross Rs. 2 Cr. By incorporation of OPC, the company can enjoy the benefits in banking point and are eligible for Banking loans, credits. So, if you want to start up your own business, you don’t have to worry about all the network and slow processes. Similar to a Company, a One Person Company is a separate legal entity from its promoter, offering limited liability protection to its sole shareholder, while having continuity of business and being easy to incorporate. Many times start-ups need to borrow money and take things on credit. In case of proprietorship firms, Proprietor’s personal savings and property would be at risk incase business is not able to repay its loans. In a one person private limited company, only investment in business is lost, personal assets of the directors are safe.The primary reason for choosing One person Company (OPC) registration is that the given person has a business idea that needs to be represented in a corporate format and the idea solely can carried out by the same person with limited resources they have. OPC Company can have more than one director, but the shareholder cannot be more than one, and also no person shall be allowed to incorporate more than 1 one person company. By incorporation of OPC, the company can enjoy the benefits in banking point of via just alike Private limited companies, One Person Companies are eligible for Banking loans, credits and enjoy the benefits of Limited liability company. At Om tax solutions we provide you a hassle free one person company registration online process which would be dealt by our professionals within a time frame of 15 working days and is subjective to governmental processing time.

    <h2 class="title mb-3"><br>Limited Liability Partnership Registration</h2>
      <p class="mb-0">A limited liability partnership (LLP) is a partnership in which some or all partners (depending on the jurisdiction) have limited liabilities. It therefore can exhibit elements of partnerships and corporations. In an LLP, each partner is not responsible or liable for another partner's misconduct or negligence. This is an important difference from the traditional partnership under the UK Partnership Act 1890, in which each partner has joint (but not several) liability. In an LLP, some or all partners have a form of limited liability similar to that of the shareholders of a corporation. Unlike corporate shareholders, the partners have the right to manage the business directly.[1] In contrast, corporate shareholders must elect a board of directors under the laws of various state charters.[1] The board organizes itself (also under the laws of the various state charters) and hires corporate officers who then have as "corporate" individuals the legal responsibility to manage the corporation in the corporation's best interest. An LLP also contains a different level of tax liability from that of a corporation.
<br><br>Limited liability partnerships are distinct from limited partnerships in some countries, which may allow all LLP partners to have limited liability, while a limited partnership may require at least one unlimited partner and allow others to assume the role of a passive and limited liability investor. As a result, in these countries, the LLP is more suited for businesses in which all investors wish to take an active role in management.
<br><br>Company Mate team takes care of the documents required for Limited Liability Partnership registration and assures hassle free registration of LLP at affordable Prices.
<br><br>Also We cover After Incorporation Mandatory Compliance to be fulfilled by the LLP ,At Affordable Packages.
